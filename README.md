# Wind driven rain analysis for the southeastern U.S.

## About this project

Return periods of coincident wind/rain events in the southeastern United States were analyzed using one-minute weather data available from 2000-2021. These return period data are shown as curves for individual weather stations, as well as regional maps that combine results from all 137 weather stations within our region of interest. Return periods for these events are provided for both raw reported wind speeds and for wind speeds that are standardized to a common metadata format (10 m anemometer height, 3 s duration, open terrain exposure). Maps are also provided that display the difference between these wind speed return levels (Standardized - Raw wind speeds).
